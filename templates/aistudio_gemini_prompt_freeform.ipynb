You will receive a messy transcript as input. Your task is to improve it by following these steps:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Spell-check:** Carefully review the entire transcript for spelling errors. Correct any misspellings while preserving the original meaning. Pay close attention to industry-specific terms related to food catering.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Rephrase:** Rephrase any awkward or unclear sentences in the transcript. Ensure the rephrased sentences are grammatically correct, flow smoothly, and maintain the original context within the food catering domain.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Summarize:** Summarize and concisely capture the main points of the rephrased transcript regarding food catering services. Focus on the key details like order details, delivery instructions, relevant rules or regulations, and any Q&A with the customer. You **must** include the specific answers provided by the salesperson so that the policies and procedures discussed can clearly be understood through the summary itself. Make sure to remove customer's name, contact number, or email address for privacy concerns.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Classify:** Based on the summary, classify the text to determine the category of the transcript, this includes: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"order placement\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"order amendment/modification\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"delivery/logistics\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"pricing/payments\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"refunds/cancellations\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"complaints/feedback\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"general faq\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which consists of general customer inquiries (e.g. prices, dishes, menu options, etc.) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"irrelevant\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\n5. **Determine:** Based on the messy transcript, and the following list of official branches:[neo garden, chilli manis, delihub, cater co, kim paradise, orange clove, tingkat, best catering, savoury catering, umisushi, kryston], determine the branch of the current transcript. If none match, say 'unknown'.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nOutput valid JSON with no extra keys. You **must not** include any invalid backslashes. Do not escape the $ symbol.

You will receive a messy transcript as input. Your task is to improve it by following these steps:\\n\\n1. **Spell-check:** Carefully review the entire transcript for spelling errors. Correct any misspellings while preserving the original meaning. Pay close attention to industry-specific terms related to food catering.\\n\\n2. **Rephrase:** Rephrase any awkward or unclear sentences in the transcript. Ensure the rephrased sentences are grammatically correct, flow smoothly, and maintain the original context within the food catering domain.\\n\\n3. **Summarize:** Summarize and concisely capture the main points of the rephrased transcript regarding food catering services. Focus on the key details like order details, delivery instructions, relevant rules or regulations, and any Q&A with the customer. You **must** include the specific answers provided by the salesperson so that the policies and procedures discussed can clearly be understood through the summary itself. Make sure to remove customer\\'s name, contact number, or email address for privacy concerns.\\n\\n4. **Classify:** Based on the summary, classify the text to determine the category of the transcript, this includes: \\\\\\\"order placement\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"order amendment/modification\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"delivery/logistics\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"pricing/payments\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"refunds/cancellations\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"complaints/feedback\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"general faq\\\\\\\" which consists of general customer inquiries (e.g. prices, dishes, menu options, etc.) and \\\\\\\"irrelevant\\\\\\\".\\n\\n5. **Determine:** Based on the messy transcript, and the following list of official branches:[neo garden, chilli manis, delihub, cater co, kim paradise, orange clove, tingkat, best catering, savoury catering, umisushi, kryston], determine the branch of the current transcript. If none match, say \\'unknown\\'.\\\\\\\"\\n\\nOutput valid JSON with no extra keys. You **must not** include any invalid backslashes. Do not escape the $ symbol.
